# Oracle Multicloud Strategy

---

## Current Enterprise Cloud Migration Reality  

### Migration Statistics
- Less than 20% of existing mission-critical enterprise workloads have migrated to cloud  
- 70% of enterprises are currently moving or planning to move on-premise workloads to cloud  
- Migration numbers are rapidly changing  

### Enterprise Challenges
- Organizations have already chosen strategic cloud providers  
- Mission-critical databases (Oracle Engineered Systems) remain on-premise  
- Many solutions have stalled:  
  - Stuck on-premise with no clear migration path  
  - Unable to receive cloud benefits (modernization, innovation, economic advantages)

## Multicloud Adoption Trends  

### Industry Response
- 81% of organizations now work with two or more public cloud providers (Gartner report)  
- Multicloud strategy = freedom to use best cloud for each workload  
- Includes additional cost-saving advantages

## Multicloud Strategy Definition  

### Core Concept
- **Multicloud**: Use of multiple cloud computing and storage services in a single heterogeneous architecture  
- **Distribution**: Cloud assets, software, and applications across multiple cloud hosting environments  
- **Goal**: Eliminate reliance on any single cloud provider  
- **Recognition**: No single cloud provider can meet all enterprise needs  

### Key Benefits
- Flexibility in service selection  
- Reduced dependence on one provider

## Reasons for Adopting Multicloud Platform  

1. **Best of Breed Innovation**  
   - Workloads use most suitable cloud services  
   - Optimized for particular use cases  

2. **Risk Reduction & Redundancy**  
   - Apps deployed across two cloud providers  
   - Higher reliability and fault tolerance  

3. **Latency Reduction**  
   - Local cloud vendors improve performance for dispersed organizations  
   - Cloud selection based on facility location  

4. **Compliance & Governance**  
   - Multiple providers ensure adherence to sovereignty laws  
   - Meet regulatory requirements  

5. **Multicloud Economics**  
   - Use public cloud instead of building/maintaining own data centers  
   - Virtual data center environment  
   - Cost optimization through competition  

6. **Reduced Vendor Lock-in**  
   - Spread risk across multiple providers  
   - Avoid overdependence on one vendor  
   - More negotiating power
