### Roles in Data Science and Their Tools  

**Data Engineers**  
- Build custom pipelines and storage systems to ensure data is accessible and reliable.  

**Data Analysts**  
- Interpret and visualize data, turning it into stories that anyone can understand.  

**Data Scientists**  
- Apply statistics and machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and trends.  

**Machine Learning Scientists**  
- Focus on building advanced models.  
- Use sophisticated algorithms.  
- Push beyond traditional approaches in predictive modeling.

### Chapter 1 (Summary)  
This chapter introduces the world of Data Science, its uses, and its real-world applications.  

In essence, Data Science powers many of the applications and platforms we use daily. For example, in an e-commerce app like **Shopee**, the recommendations you see are not randomâ€”they are generated through Data Science techniques.  

Data Science involves collecting, analyzing, and using data to make predictions with algorithms and machine learning models.  

This chapter also explains the distinctions among the various roles in the data field:  
- **Data Engineers** create pipelines and systems to make data accessible.  
- **Data Analysts** transform data into understandable stories.  
- **Data Scientists** go further by generating predictions and insights that benefit organizations.  
- **Machine Learning Scientists** design and improve machine learning models, pushing the boundaries of traditional methods.  
- **AI Engineers** apply these models to real-world scenarios, such as self-driving cars, AI-integrated homes, and other smart technologies.
