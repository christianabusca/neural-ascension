# Understanding Data Topics  

## Understanding Data Science  

### Data Science  

#### Key Processes  
- **Collecting data**  
- **Analyzing data**  
- **Transforming data into insights**  

---

### What is Data Science?  
Data Science is a field that makes sense of the vast amount of information we generate.  

- Uses data to understand needs, preferences, and behaviors.  
- Involves taking raw data, cleaning it, and extracting patterns to generate insights.  

---

### Applications of Data Science  
- Personalized recommendations (e.g., shopping platforms, streaming services).  

---

### Roles in Data Science and Their Tools  

**Data Engineers**  
- Build custom pipelines and storage systems to ensure data is accessible and reliable.  

**Data Analysts**  
- Interpret and visualize data, turning it into stories that anyone can understand.  

**Data Scientists**  
- Apply statistics and machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and trends.  

**Machine Learning Scientists**  
- Focus on building advanced models.  
- Use sophisticated algorithms.  
- Push beyond traditional approaches in predictive modeling.  

**AI Engineers**  
- Specialize in integrating AI models into real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, smart homes, and intelligent assistants.

### ðŸ“– Chapter 1 (Summary)  
This chapter introduces the world of Data Science, its uses, and its real-world applications.  

In essence, Data Science powers many of the applications and platforms we use daily. For example, in an e-commerce app like **Shopee**, the recommendations you see are not randomâ€”they are generated through Data Science techniques.  

Data Science involves collecting, analyzing, and using data to make predictions with algorithms and machine learning models.  

This chapter also explains the distinctions among the various roles in the data field:  
- **Data Engineers** create pipelines and systems to make data accessible.  
- **Data Analysts** transform data into understandable stories.  
- **Data Scientists** generate predictions and insights that benefit organizations.  
- **Machine Learning Scientists** design and improve machine learning models.  
- **AI Engineers** apply these models to real-world scenarios, such as self-driving cars and smart technologies.

## Data Sources & Data Science Workflow

### Sources of Data

#### Company Data
- Collected by companies for business purposes  
- Supports data-driven decisions  
- Examples: **Web events, survey data, customer data**

#### Open Data
- **Data APIs** â€“ request data from 3rd parties over the internet  
- **Public Records** â€“ shared by organizations  
- **Statistical Offices & Government Agencies** â€“ publish data on weather, environment, and population  

---

### Data Types

- **Quantitative Data** â€“ numerical, measurable  
- **Qualitative Data** â€“ descriptive, not measured with numbers  

#### Other Data Types
- **Image Data**  
- **Text Data**  
- **Geospatial Data** â€“ with location info  
- **Network Data** â€“ shows relationships (e.g., social connections)  

---

### Data Storage and Retrieval

#### Workflow Steps
1. **Data Collection and Storage**  
2. **Data Processing and Transformation**  
3. **Data Analysis and Visualization**  

#### Considerations
- **Location** â€“ where to store (local/cloud)  
- **Data Type** â€“ structured vs. unstructured  
- **Retrieval** â€“ efficiency in accessing data  

#### Types of Data Storage
- **Document Database** â€“ stores unstructured data (emails, video, web pages); uses **NoSQL**  
- **Relational Database** â€“ stores structured tables; uses **SQL**  

---

### Data Pipelines
- Automates data movement and storage  
- Can be **scheduled** or **event-triggered**  
- Monitored with alerts  
- Critical for **big data**  
- Maintained by **Data Engineers**  

---

### ETL Process
1. **Extract** â€“ collect data from sources (APIs, IoT, databases)  
2. **Transform** â€“ clean, organize, and prepare data  
   - Join datasets  
   - Restructure  
   - Remove irrelevant info  
3. **Load** â€“ save data into storage for analysis/visualization  

---

### ðŸ“– Chapter 2 (Summary) 
- Data comes from **company sources** (surveys, customer data) and **open data** (APIs, government records).  
- Two main data types: **Quantitative (numbers)** and **Qualitative (descriptions)**, plus other forms like **text, image, geospatial, and network data**.  
- Data must be stored and retrieved efficiently, considering **location, type, and retrieval method**.  
- Storage systems include **relational databases (SQL)** and **document databases (NoSQL)**.  
- **Data pipelines** automate movement and processing to handle large-scale or continuous data.  
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** ensures data is collected, cleaned, and prepared for analysis.
