# Understanding Machine Learning

## Machine Learning Fundamentals

### What is Machine Learning?
**Machine Learning:** A set of tools for making inferences and predictions from data

- **Core Definition:** ML learns patterns from existing data and applies them to new, unseen data
- **No Explicit Programming:** Computers learn without step-by-step instructions
- **Foundation Sciences:** Statistics and Computer Science
- **Critical Success Factor:** High-quality data is essential

### Machine Learning vs Artificial Intelligence
**AI** = A huge set of tools for making computers behave intelligently
- Comprises several sub-fields: Robotics, Machine Learning, and other specialized areas
- When people refer to "AI" today, they're most likely referring to **machine learning**
- Machine learning has become the **most prevalent subset of AI** in recent decades

### Real-World Applications of Machine Learning
**Gaming:**
- ML algorithms have beaten humans at complex games: Chess, GO, StarCraft

**Healthcare:**
- Better medical diagnoses
- Improved treatment recommendations

**Daily Technology:**
- Intelligent assistants
- Mobile apps
- Various consumer technologies

**Future Applications:**
- Self-driving cars
- Deepfakes and believable synthetic content

### Machine Learning Capabilities

**Two Main Tasks:**

**1. Prediction**
- **Focus:** Outcome of future events
- **Example:** Will it rain tomorrow?

**2. Inference**
- **Focus:** Drawing insights and understanding
- **Examples:**
  - **Causal inference:** Why does it rain? (factors: month, humidity, temperature)
  - **Pattern recognition:** What are different types of weather conditions? (rain, overcast, etc.)

## Types of Machine Learning

### Three Main Types

**1. Supervised Learning**
- **Most common type** of machine learning
- Uses **labeled training data**
- **Example:** Heart disease prediction with known outcomes
- **When to use:** You have labeled data and want to predict specific outcomes

**2. Unsupervised Learning**
- **Second most common type**
- Uses **unlabeled data** (features only)
- **Common Tasks:** Anomaly detection, Clustering
- **Example:** Grouping patients by similar characteristics
- **When to use:** Labels are unavailable or unknown

**3. Reinforcement Learning**
- **Use Case:** Deciding sequential actions
- **Examples:** Robot path planning, Chess game moves
- **Characteristics:** Less common, uses complex mathematics (game theory)

### Supervised Learning Deep Dive

**Key Components:**

**Target Variable**
- What we want to predict
- **Example:** "Heart Disease" (True/False)
- **Also called:** Dependent variable, outcome variable

**Labels**
- Known values for the target variable
- **Example:** "True" or "False" for heart disease presence

**Observations/Examples**
- Individual rows/records in the dataset
- **Example:** Each patient's complete record

**Features**
- Different pieces of information that help predict the target
- **Example:** Age, cholesterol levels, smoking habits
- **Power of ML:** Can analyze many features simultaneously

---

### Unsupervised Learning Deep Dive

**Key Characteristics:**
- **No labels** in training data
- **Only features** available
- Model finds its own patterns without guidance

**Example: Patient Type Discovery**
1. **Filter Data:** Select only patients with heart disease
2. **Input Features:** Age, cholesterol, blood sugar, etc.
3. **Clustering:** Model groups similar patients together
4. **Output:** Patient categories for better treatment research

## Machine Learning Models

### What is a Machine Learning Model?
**Machine Learning Model:** A statistical representation of a real-world process

**Model Functionality:**
1. **Training:** Model is created using historical data
2. **Input:** Enter new inputs into the trained model
3. **Output:** Get predictions or outcomes

**Types of Outputs:**
- **Direct Predictions:** Specific outcomes
- **Probabilistic Predictions:** Probability of an outcome (e.g., 75% chance a tweet is fake)

## Machine Learning Workflow

### The Four Essential Steps

**1. Extract Features**
- Transform raw dataset into usable features for machine learning
- **Key Activities:** Reformat dataset, feature selection
- **Example:** Square feet, neighborhood, distance to subway station

**2. Split Dataset**
- Divide original dataset into two separate datasets
- **Training Dataset:** Used to train the model
- **Test Dataset:** Used to evaluate the model (kept separate)
- **Why Split:** Prevents bias, simulates real-world usage

**3. Train Model**
- Input the training dataset into a chosen machine learning model
- **Model Examples:** Neural networks, logistic regression
- **Key Point:** Model selection depends on the specific problem and data characteristics

**4. Evaluate**
- Test model performance on unseen data
- **Process:** Compare model predictions to actual known values
- **Decision Point:** Is performance good enough?
  - âœ… If yes â†’ Model is ready to use
  - ðŸ”„ If no â†’ Return to Step 3: Tune the Model

### Example Scenario: NYC Apartment Price Prediction

**Dataset Description:**
- **Source:** New York City monthly apartment sales records
- **Target Variable:** Sale price (what we want to predict)
- **Problem Type:** Supervised learning
- **Features:** Square feet, neighborhood, year built, etc.

**Evaluation Example:**
- **Metric:** 80% of apartment prices predicted accurately within 10% margin
- **Question:** Is this performance acceptable for deployment?

### Data Science Connection

**Data Science Definition:**
- **Purpose:** Discovering and communicating insights from data

**Relationship with Machine Learning:**
- Machine learning is often an **important tool** for data science work
- Especially valuable for **making predictions from data**
- Complementary fields that work together
