## Data Basics
### Understanding Data
#### What is Data?
- **Definition**: "Data" comes from the Latin word "datum," meaning "fact"
- **Reality**: Data is everywhere around us without us realizing it
- **Personal data**: Your name, age, hobbies, number of shirts, coffee consumption
- **Digital data**: Social media comments, videos, photos
- **Universal data**: Number of trees in a city, distance between Earth and moon

### The Importance of Context
**Data gains value with context**
- Raw data without context has limited meaning
- **Example**: Goals scored by Messi (footballer) vs. Ovechkin (hockey player)
  - Numbers alone don't determine who's better
  - Need to understand different sports contexts
- **Data context**: Missing knowledge that explains the data
- **Metadata**: Details about when, where, and how data was collected

### Types of Data
**By Structure:**
- **Structured Data**
  - Organized and labeled (like spreadsheets)
  - Easy to filter and analyze
  - Examples: sales records, employee attendance, weather data
  
- **Unstructured Data**
  - Appears without labels or clear organization
  - Harder to analyze directly but offers rich insights
  - Examples: videos, interviews, product pictures

**By Information Type:**
- **Quantitative Data (Numerical)**
  - Involves numbers and measurements
  - Ideal for calculations and visualizations
  - Examples: points scored, height, temperature
  
- **Qualitative Data (Categorical)**
  - Describes things grouped into categories
  - Useful for spotting patterns and trends
  - Examples: favorite sports, customer feedback

### The Curious Case of Data Growth
#### Data Volume Explosion
- **2010**: 2 zettabytes of data created, captured, consumed, and stored
- **2021**: 40 times larger than 2010 (approximately 80 zettabytes)
- **Growth pattern**: Exponential increase over the last decade

#### Evolution of Data Storage
**Historical Timeline:**
- **Ancient times**: DNA (nature's data storage), cave paintings, wall art
- **Civilizations**: Chinese, Egyptians, Romans used scrolls and papyrus/parchment books
- **1890s**: Punch cards became popular
- **Mid-20th century**: Magnetic tape and floppy disks
- **Recent times**: CD, hard drives, solid-state drives
- **Internet era**: Centralized cloud storage in data centers

#### Why Data Growth Matters: The Ice Cream Shop Example
**Shop 1 (Simple Operations):**
- Sells only 3 flavors: vanilla, chocolate, strawberry
- Runs out of stock regularly
- Relies on gut feeling for restocking

**Shop 2 (Data-Driven Operations):**
- Sells 20+ ice cream flavors plus coffee and milkshakes
- Uses electronic cash register to monitor all sales
- **Data captured**:
  - Sales data per product type and flavor
  - Stock levels via barcode scanning
  - Weather data (temperature affects ice cream sales)
- **Data applications**:
  - Prevents stockouts of popular flavors
  - Replaces poor-selling flavors
  - Predicts sales spikes using weather
  - Calculates profit margins per product

**Result**: Shop 2's data-driven decisions lead to increased revenue compared to gut-feeling decisions.

#### Data in Complex Operations
**As company complexity increases, so does data generation:**
- **3D Manufacturing**: Sensors measure beam heat, layer thickness, structural stability
- **Financial Institutions**: Data for mortgage applications, fraud detection

  - Average inventory (goods stored over specified period)
  - Inventory turnover ratio (how often inventory is sold and replaced)
- **Analytics focus**: Making sense of massive supply chain data
- **Common technique**: Demand forecasting to ensure right products are in stock

**Education:**
- **Applications**:
  - Analyze user feedback and course performance
  - Identify where students struggle
  - Tailor content to individual learner needs and abilities
- **Example**: DataCamp uses data to improve course design based on student interactions and performance

#### Data as Competitive Advantage
**Unique Value Proposition:**
- Every organization's data is unique to them
- Competitors cannot access the same data
- Organizations compete on data utilization rather than just gut feeling
- Data-driven decisions provide sustainable competitive advantages
