# Phase 1 — Foundation Building (8–12 weeks)
**Branch:** `phase1-arcane-foundations`  
**Focus:** Core programming, data literacy, and essential BI tools.

## What this path is about
This phase lays the groundwork for everything that follows. You’ll build practical fluency with Python, spreadsheets, SQL, and BI tooling while learning how to think and communicate with data. By the end, you should be able to ingest, clean, explore, and summarize datasets—and present basic insights clearly.

## What you’ll learn (outcomes)
- Explain core data concepts: types, distributions, sampling, bias, data lifecycle.
- Read, clean, and reshape data in **Python** (Pandas) and **spreadsheets** (Excel/Google Sheets).
- Create basic charts and dashboards in **Power BI**; understand when to use each chart.
- Query relational databases with **SQL**: SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOIN, aggregate functions.
- Tell a simple, compelling data story with visuals, narrative, and metrics.
- Use version control basics with **Git/GitHub** (commit/push/PR) for your learning notes.

## Topics & tracks covered
- **Data Literacy Professional**; **Understanding Data Topics**  
- **Python Programming Fundamentals**; **Python Data Fundamentals**  
- **Excel Fundamentals**; **Google Sheets Fundamentals**; **Power BI Fundamentals**  
- **SQL Fundamentals**

## Prerequisites
- None. Just commitment and consistency (30–60 minutes/day).

## Milestones & deliverables
- **Milestone 1:** Data Literacy Notes — concise summary of key concepts (1–2 pages).  
- **Milestone 2:** Python Mini-Notebook — load a CSV, clean, summarize, and chart.  
- **Milestone 3:** SQL Query Pack — 8–10 queries solving business-style questions.  
- **Milestone 4:** Power BI Starter Dashboard — 3–5 visuals + 1 KPI card.
- **Deliverable:** Short write-up (500–700 words) explaining findings and trade-offs.

## Portfolio ideas
- “Sales Snapshot” dashboard with filters and drillthrough.  
- “Data Cleaning 101” notebook: raw → tidy dataset with before/after metrics.

## Completion criteria (exit checklist)
- [ ] You can explain joins (inner/left/right) with a concrete example.  
- [ ] You can pivot/unpivot data in Excel or Python.  
- [ ] You can produce a simple KPI dashboard in Power BI.  
- [ ] You pushed all work to GitHub with a clear README section.

## Time & pacing
- **8–12 weeks**, ~5–7 hrs/week. Prioritize steady practice over cramming.
