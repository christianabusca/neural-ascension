**Main Takeaway**: Successful analytics initiatives require systematic translation of broad business questions into specific, data-driven analytical questions through collaborative processes that bridge communication gaps between business and analytics teams. The Value from Analytics workflow provides structure for ensuring analytical work directly supports strategic business objectives, while the SMART framework ensures questions are actionable and measurable. Critical success factors include recognizing that business questions are qualitative and broad while analytical questions must be specific and data-driven, understanding that translation challenges are natural but can be overcome through proper communication and collaboration, and ensuring that analytical solutions ultimately get used by business teams to create real value. Organizations that master this translation process create sustainable competitive advantages by consistently converting data capabilities into business impact through focused, relevant analytical solutions that address actual business needs rather than just technical possibilities.
